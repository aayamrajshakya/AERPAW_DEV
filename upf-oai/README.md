                             OPENAIR-CN-5G
 An implementation of the 5G Core network by the OpenAirInterface community.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPENAIR-CN-5G is an implementation of the 3GPP specifications for the 5G Core Network.
At the moment, it contains the following network elements:

* Access and Mobility Management Function (**AMF**)
* Authentication Server Management Function (**AUSF**)
* Location Management Function (**LMF**)
* Network Exposure Function (**NEF**)
* Network Slicing Selection Function (**NSSF**)
* Network Repository Function (**NRF**)
* Network Data Analytics Function (**NWDAF**)
* Policy Control Function (**PCF**)
* Session Management Function (**SMF**)
* Unified Data Management (**UDM**)
* Unified Data Repository (**UDR**)
* Unstructured Data Storage Function (**UDSF**)
* User Plane Function (**UPF**)
  
Each element implementation has its own repository: this repository (`oai-upf`) is meant for UPF.

# Where to start

The Openair-CN-5G UPF code is written, executed, and tested on UBUNTU server focal/jammy version.
Other Linux distributions support will be added later on.

More details on the supported feature set is available on this [page](docs/FEATURE_SET.md).

# Collaborative work

This source code is managed through a GITLAB server, a collaborative development platform:

*  URL: [https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-upf](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-upf).

Process is explained in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

# Contribution requests

In a general way, anybody who is willing can contribute on any part of the
code in any network component.

Contributions can be simple bugfixes, advices and remarks on the design,
architecture, coding/implementation.

# Release Notes

They are available on the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file.
