1. Get the application name by running these commands:
  export GNB__CU_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "oai-gnb-cu-up.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
2. Dockerhub images of OpenAirInterface requires avx2 capabilities in the cpu and they are built for x86 architecture, tested on UBUNTU OS only.
3. If you want to configure for a particular band then copy the configuration file in templates/configmap.yaml from here https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/-/tree/develop/targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-NR-5GC/CONF
4. For good performance make sure your underlying kernel is realtime and CPU sleep states are off
