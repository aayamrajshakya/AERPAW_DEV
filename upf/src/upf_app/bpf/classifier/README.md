In this implementation, the `qfi_classifier` function performs packet classification based on the destination port and stores the corresponding QFI in the packet data. The `token_bucket_filter` function implements the token bucket algorithm for traffic shaping and QoS enforcement based on the QFI and QER configuration.

To utilize this eBPF program with `tc` and `qdisc`, you would follow these steps:

1. Compile the eBPF program into an object file named `new_version.o`.

2. Use the `system()` function to execute the `tc` commands from within your C code to create the necessary qdisc and configure traffic shaping and packet classification rules.

3. Attach the compiled eBPF program to the qdisc using the `tc filter add` command.

Please note that the `tc` commands should be executed with appropriate privileges, typically as the root user or with `sudo`.

Remember to customize the QFI classification and QER configuration based on your specific requirements.

If you have any further questions, please let me know.





Apologies for the oversight. In the token_bucket_filter function, when the return value is TC_ACT_OK, it indicates that the packet should be allowed to pass through without any further modification. You can consider adding the appropriate tc command to continue processing the packet normally. Here's an updated version of the function to include the TC_ACT_OK handling:




-----------------------------------------
 Let me explain how this code can be used with tc and qdisc.

    Compile the eBPF program:

    r

clang -O2 -target bpf -c qer_program.c -o qer_program.o

Load the eBPF program into the kernel:

bash

ip -force link set dev <interface> xdp obj qer_program.o

Replace <interface> with the name of the network interface where you want to apply the QER. For example, if you want to apply it to the eth0 interface, the command would be:

bash

ip -force link set dev eth0 xdp obj qer_program.o

Note that loading the eBPF program requires root privileges.

Configure traffic control rules using tc and qdisc:

csharp

tc qdisc add dev <interface> root handle 1: htb
tc class add dev <interface> parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate <rate> burst <burst>
tc qdisc add dev <interface> parent 1:1 handle 10: sfq perturb 10

Replace <interface> with the name of the network interface where you applied the QER (same as in step 2). <rate> and <burst> are the desired rate and burst values for traffic shaping, respectively. Adjust these values according to your requirements.

Configure QER parameters using the qer_map:

c

    struct qer_data qer_config = {
        .qfi = 1,                           // Set the QFI for this QER configuration
        .token_bucket_size = 1000000,       // Set the token bucket size (in bytes)
        .rate = 10000000,                   // Set the rate (in bps)
    };

    bpf_map_update_elem(&qer_map, &qer_config.qfi, &qer_config, BPF_ANY);

    You can add multiple QER configurations by repeating the bpf_map_update_elem() call with different QFI values and corresponding QER parameters.

With the above steps, the eBPF program will classify packets based on their QFI using the qfi_classifier function. The token_bucket_filter function will then apply token bucket filtering based on the QER configurations and the token bucket map.

The traffic control rules defined with tc and qdisc will shape the traffic according to the configured rate and burst parameters.

Remember to replace <interface>, <rate>, and <burst> with the appropriate values for your network setup.

I hope this clarifies how the code can be used with tc and qdisc. Let me know if you have any further questions!
